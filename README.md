# ECommerce_Churn Analysis

## ðŸŽ¯Project Overview 

This project aims to comprehensively explore an e-commerce churn dataset, examining numerical summaries, categorical distributions, correlations, customer segmentation, missing value identification, and a detailed churn rate analysis across tenure ranges to glean insights into customer behaviour and churn patterns.

## âœ¨ Data Sources 
The E-Commerce Churn dataset has been obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitverma2010/ecommerce-customer-churn-analysis-and-prediction/data)

## âš¡ Tools 
- MS SQL Server
- Excel
- Tableau

## ðŸŽ¯Data Cleaning and Preparation 
To begin the analysis, we had to better understand the data and correct for errors within our dataset. To accomplish this, we performed the following tasks: 
- Data loading and review
- Error handling
- Cleaning and formatting

## âœ¨ Exploratory Analysis 
We explored the dataset to answer the following questions: 

- What is the overall churn rate?
Purpose: Understand the percentage of customers who have stopped using the service or product. This provides an initial overview of customer attrition.

- Which demographic groups exhibit the highest churn rate?
Purpose: Identify specific customer segments (age, gender, city tier, marital status, etc.) more prone to churning. This helps in targeted retention strategies for vulnerable groups.

- Do cashback incentives, paymentmode and complaints affect customer retention?
Purpose: Evaluate if customers receiving cashback are less likely to churn. Insights can help in optimizing incentive programs for retention.

- How long do churned customers spend on the app?

- How do different preferred device users compare in terms of churn?
Purpose: Understand if customers using a particular login device have a higher tendency to churn. This may aid in optimizing services for specific device users.

- What is the relationship between Tenure and Churn Rate?
Purpose: Explore if there is a tenure range expected for churn. This is for segmentation and to allow for proper retention strategies according to tenure.

- Is there a relationship between the number of devices registered and churn?
Purpose: Investigate if customers with multiple registered devices are more or less likely to churn. This insight may influence device-specific engagement strategies.

- How does satisfaction score relate to churn?
Purpose: Analyze whether dissatisfied customers are more prone to churn. This can inform efforts to improve satisfaction levels and retain customers.

- What is the impact of order frequency on churn?
Purpose: Investigate if customers who make frequent orders are less likely to churn. Insights can guide efforts to increase customer engagement.
