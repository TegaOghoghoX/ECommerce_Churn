# ECommerce_Churn Analysis

## ðŸŽ¯Project Overview 

This project aims to comprehensively explore an e-commerce churn dataset, examining numerical summaries, categorical distributions, correlations, customer segmentation, missing value identification, and a detailed churn rate analysis across tenure ranges to glean insights into customer behaviour and churn patterns.

## âœ¨ Data Sources 
The E-Commerce Churn dataset has been obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitverma2010/ecommerce-customer-churn-analysis-and-prediction/data)

## âš¡ Tools 
- MS SQL Server
- Excel
- Tableau

## ðŸŽ¯Data Cleaning and Preparation 
To begin the analysis, we had to better understand the data and correct for errors within our dataset. To accomplish this, we performed the following tasks: 
- Data loading and review
- Error handling
- Cleaning and formatting 
  
## âœ¨ Exploratory Analysis 
We explored the dataset to answer the following questions: 

- What is the overall churn rate?
Purpose: Understand the percentage of customers who have stopped using the service or product. This provides an initial overview of customer attrition.

- Which demographic groups exhibit the highest churn rate?
Purpose: Identify specific customer segments (age, gender, city tier, marital status, etc.) more prone to churning. This helps in targeted retention strategies for vulnerable groups.

- Do cashback incentives, paymentmode and complaints affect customer retention?
Purpose: Evaluate if customers receiving cashback are less likely to churn. Insights can help in optimizing incentive programs for retention.

- How long do churned customers spend on the app?

- How do different preferred device users compare in terms of churn?
Purpose: Understand if customers using a particular login device have a higher tendency to churn. This may aid in optimizing services for specific device users.

- What is the relationship between Tenure and Churn Rate?
Purpose: Explore if there is a tenure range expected for churn. This is for segmentation and to allow for proper retention strategies according to tenure. 

- Is there a relationship between the number of devices registered and churn?
Purpose: Investigate if customers with multiple registered devices are more or less likely to churn. This insight may influence device-specific engagement strategies.

- How does satisfaction score relate to churn?
Purpose: Analyze whether dissatisfied customers are more prone to churn. This can inform efforts to improve satisfaction levels and retain customers.

- What is the impact of order frequency on churn?
Purpose: Investigate if customers who make frequent orders are less likely to churn. Insights can guide efforts to increase customer engagement.

## âš¡ Data Analysis 

This allows us to get a view of the intial dataset 

```sql 
SELECT *
FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
```

We see there are several columns with NULL values, hence, we need to understand the statistic in these coulumns to know if the AVG would be ideal for imputing NULL values
```sql 
SELECT 
    AVG(Tenure) AS Avg_Tenure, 
    MAX(Tenure) AS Max_Tenure, 
    MIN(Tenure) AS Min_Tenure, 
    ROUND(STDEV(Tenure),3) AS StdDev_Tenure
FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
```
```sql 
SELECT 
    AVG(HourSpendOnApp) AS Avg_Hour_Spend_On_App, 
    MAX(HourSpendOnApp) AS Max_Hour_Spend_On_App, 
    MIN(HourSpendOnApp) AS Min_Hour_Spend_On_App, 
    ROUND(STDEV(HourSpendOnApp),3) AS StdDev_Hour_Spend_On_App
FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
```
```sql 
SELECT 
    AVG(WarehouseToHome) AS Avg_Warehouse_To_Home, 
    MAX(WarehouseToHome) AS Max_Warehouse_To_Home, 
    MIN(WarehouseToHome) AS Min_Warehouse_To_Home, 
    ROUND(STDEV(WarehouseToHome),3) AS StdDev_Warehouse_To_Home
FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
```
```sql 
SELECT 
    AVG(CouponUsed) AS Avg_Coupon_Used, 
    MAX(CouponUsed) AS Max_Coupon_Used, 
    MIN(CouponUsed) AS Min_Coupon_Used, 
    ROUND(STDEV(CouponUsed),3) AS StdDev_Coupon_Used
FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
```
```sql 
SELECT 
    AVG(DaySinceLastOrder) AS Avg_Day_Since_Last_Order, 
    MAX(DaySinceLastOrder) AS Max_Day_Since_Last_Order, 
    MIN(DaySinceLastOrder) AS Min_Day_Since_Last_Order, 
    ROUND(STDEV(DaySinceLastOrder),3) AS StdDev_Day_Since_Last_Order
FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
```
```sql 
SELECT 
    AVG(OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear) AS Avg_Order_Amount_Hike_From_last_Year, 
    MAX(OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear) AS Max_Order_Amount_Hike_From_last_Year, 
    MIN(OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear) AS Min_Order_Amount_Hike_From_last_Year, 
    ROUND(STDEV(OrderAmountHikeFromlastYear),3) AS StdDev_Order_Amount_Hike_From_last_Year
FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
```
```sql 
SELECT 
    AVG(OrderCount) AS Avg_Order_Count, 
    MAX(OrderCount) AS Max_Order_Count, 
    MIN(OrderCount) AS Min_Order_Count, 
    ROUND(STDEV(OrderCount),3) AS StdDev_Order_Count
FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
```

From this, we can then impute the AVG into the NULL cells in our dataset without distorting the AVG values for each column 
```sql 
UPDATE [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
SET Hourspendonapp = (SELECT AVG(Hourspendonapp) FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset])
WHERE Hourspendonapp IS NULL
```
```sql 
UPDATE [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
SET tenure = (SELECT AVG(tenure) FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset])
WHERE tenure IS NULL 
```
```sql 
UPDATE [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
SET orderamounthikefromlastyear = (SELECT AVG(orderamounthikefromlastyear) FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset])
WHERE orderamounthikefromlastyear IS NULL 
```
```sql 
UPDATE [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
SET WarehouseToHome = (SELECT  AVG(WarehouseToHome) FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset])
WHERE WarehouseToHome IS NULL 
```
```sql 
UPDATE [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
SET couponused = (SELECT AVG(couponused) FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset])
WHERE couponused IS NULL 
```
```sql 
UPDATE [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
SET ordercount = (SELECT AVG(ordercount) FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset])
WHERE ordercount IS NULL 
```
```sql 
UPDATE [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
SET daysincelastorder = (SELECT AVG(daysincelastorder) FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset])
WHERE daysincelastorder IS NULL 
```
All NULL values have now been imputed 
```sql 
SELECT *
FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset] 
```
We noticed some redundant data in our dataset and needs to be corrected. 
```sql 
SELECT preferredlogindevice 
FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
GROUP BY PreferredLoginDevice
```
```sql 
UPDATE [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
SET preferredlogindevice = 'phone'
WHERE preferredlogindevice = 'mobile phone'
```
```sql 
SELECT PreferedOrderCat
FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
GROUP BY PreferedOrderCat
```
```sql 
UPDATE [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
SET PreferedOrderCat = 'Mobile Phone'
WHERE PreferedOrderCat = 'Mobile' 
```
```sql 
SELECT PreferredPaymentMode
FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
GROUP BY PreferredPaymentMode 
```
```sql 
UPDATE [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
SET PreferredPaymentMode = 'Cash on Delivery'
WHERE PreferredPaymentMode = 'COD'
```
```sql 
UPDATE [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
SET PreferredPaymentMode = 'Credit Card'
WHERE PreferredPaymentMode = 'CC'
```
```sql 
SELECT * 
FROM [AutoSales].[dbo].[ECommerceDataset]
```
